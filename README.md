# CREATING A NETFLIX DASHBOARD USING POWER BI 






In this project, I tried to recreate the work of DataScience Roadmap using Power BI.

The Netflix dataset is made up of 12 columns and 8804 Rows. Some of the columns in
the dataset include type, director, country just to mention a few. The rows, however,
shows the individual contents uploaded unto the Netflix platform. Out of the 8804
individual contents, 6128 are Movies and 2676 are TV shows.
